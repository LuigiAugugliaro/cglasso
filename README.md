Description:
The censored graphical lasso (cglasso) estimator is an extension of the l1-penalized Gaussian graphical model (Yuan and Lin, 2007) developed to handle datasets with censored observations. This repository contains the R code needed to replicate the simulation studies and the analysis reported in the paper entitled "l1-Penalized Censored Gaussian Graphical Model" (submitted to Biostatistics).
